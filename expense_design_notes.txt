ExpenseELement                               Expenses
1.expenseElement1                            1. expenseElement1, project 1, value[], order1, rate1  
2.expenseElement2			     2. expenseElement2, project 1, value[], order2, rate2
3.expenseElement3                 ---------> 3. expenseElement3, project 1, value[], order3, rate3

Methods:

1. On creating new project, need to call this function

create Expenses (){
	- Load all expenseElement and create the same namer of expenses records with the order is ordered by Defaul_Order attribute
	- Default rate will get from defaut_Rate
}


2. On creating display M&E expense Form, need to set the order as name for each field to implement a single saving function?
Or create only one name, so all the time need to save value as a list?

3. The performance of the record which diffent type (some will have person number, some won't have person number) will be hard code to display well on UI

Notes:
Some records only have quantity, but don't have duration
-------------------------------------------

1. ExpenseElement will include the the defaultRate
- on the firt time load Expenses form, load the defaultRate from ExpenseElement.
- Since Expenses have been saved, the Rate will be got from Expenses rather than ExpenseElement

2. ExpenseJson is temporary class, used to map for View and Controller use.
